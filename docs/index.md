## ADBC Identity Provider (IDP) Specification

 * ![raw](http://rfc.unprotocols.org/spec:2/COSS/raw.svg)
 * Editor: Chris Gough
 * Contributors: Steve Capell

This document describes an [OIDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect) based federated identity model that provides identity assurance for the e-invoicng framework.  This specification does not modofy OIDC in any way.  Rather it provides a standardised set of scopes, claims, and identity assurance levels.

This specification aims to support the Australian Digital Business Council
[eInvoicing initiative](https://ausdigital.github.io), and is under active development
at [https://github.com/ausdigital/identity-provider](https://github.com/ausdigital/identity-provider).
