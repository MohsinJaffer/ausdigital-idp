# Scope


## Jurisdictions

Australia is the only jurisdiction currently supported by the ADBC IDP Specification.

The design-intent of the specification is to be applicable to any jurisdiction.

Any jurisdiction with one or more appropriate identity schemes and a suitable identity market could be included in the specification.


## Identity Schemes

The Australian Business Number (ABN) is currently the only ID Scheme supported by the ADBC IDP Specification.

The design intent is to define a standard that's applicable to any appropriate ID Scheme.


## Adding Jurisdictions and Identity Schemes to the standard

The process for adding a jurisdiction to the specification starts with raising a ticket at the [community GitHub site](https://github.com/ausdigital/ausdigital-idp). This is the same process as any other change to the Specification ([Consensus Oriented Specification System](https://rfc.unprotocols.org/spec:2/COSS/)).

The reason other jurisdictions and schemes have not been pre-emptively included, is that there is no evidence of need for these in the current community. Contribution from stakeholders in jurisdictions outside Australia would be very welcome.
